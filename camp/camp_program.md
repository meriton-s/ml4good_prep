### 1. What is the main idea behind evaluations and benchmarking in AI Safety?

- **Purpose**: Measure system capabilities, alignment, robustness, and failure modes under standardized conditions.

- **Theory**:
  - ["On the Measurement and Evaluation of AI Systems"](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2021/06/16/AIME_at_NIST-DRAFT-20210614.pdf) *(arXiv, 2022)*  
  - ["Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP models with CheckList"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04118) *(arXiv, 2020)*

- **Practice**:

Evaluations and benchmarking in AI Safety aim to systematically measure how AI systems perform on safety-relevant criteria so that researchers can identify shortcomings and track improvements over time. In essence, an evaluation is a test or task used to validate whether a model’s behavior meets certain safety standards (e.g., not producing toxic output, following instructions truthfully).

By comparing models on common benchmarks, we gain a stable, reliable way to assess progress toward safer AI. For example, OpenAI notes that having strong evals is crucial for building reliable applications — without them, it’s difficult to understand how changes in model versions or prompts affect behavior. In the AI safety context, this means we “crash-test” models for dangerous behaviors before deployment, much like putting a new car through crash tests to ensure it’s road-safe.

Ultimately, evaluations provide quantitative evidence of safety (or the lack thereof), which is vital given that AI safety as a field has historically been poorly defined and measured. Consistent benchmarks bring clarity by defining concrete safety goals (e.g., truthfulness, avoidance of bias) and empirically measuring them, instead of relying on vague intuitions.

In short, evaluations and benchmarks let us verify an AI system’s safety properties and drive research toward safer systems.

### 2. What are the main approaches used in evaluations and benchmarking?

- **Static Benchmarks**: e.g., MMLU, BIG-Bench, GLUE
- **Dynamic Evaluations**: Behavioral testing, adversarial probing, task-specific robustness

- **Resources**:
  - ["Dynabench: Rethinking Benchmarking in NLP"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14337) *(arXiv, 2021)*  
  - [BIG-bench Repository](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench) *(GitHub)*


AI safety evaluations use a mix of approaches, combining automated tests, human feedback, and adversarial challenges. One common approach is **static benchmarking**: assembling a fixed dataset of questions or tasks and measuring model performance against known correct outputs.

For example, the [OpenAI Evals framework](https://github.com/openai/evals) defines an eval as a dataset of prompts with ideal answers, where the model’s output is checked by an automatic grading script or heuristic. This can be as simple as string-matching an answer (e.g., does the model say “2008” for “What year was Obama first elected?”), or running a validation function (e.g., does the output parse as valid JSON). Such rule-based evaluation *(Practice)* is easy to implement and repeat.

Another approach is **model-based evaluation**, sometimes called *model-as-a-judge*. Here, an AI model is used to grade another model’s outputs. For instance, one can prompt GPT-4 to evaluate whether another model’s joke is funny or whether an answer is correct. This two-stage “model grading” approach leverages powerful models as automated judges, especially when human labeling is expensive or slow. Model-based evals are useful for subjective or open-ended tasks *(Practice)*, though they must be used carefully to avoid reinforcing the judge model’s biases.

Beyond static tests, **dynamic and adversarial evaluations** are increasingly important. Instead of a fixed dataset, adversarial testing generates new challenging inputs to actively probe a model’s weaknesses.

- One method is **human red-teaming** — hiring people to come up with questions or inputs designed to trick the model into unsafe behavior. [Redwood Research’s adversarial training strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01663) exemplifies this: they set up an interface where skilled human red-teamers iteratively find prompts that cause a language model to output violent content, retrain the model to handle those, and repeat. This adaptive stress-testing reveals failure modes that static test sets might miss *(Practice)*.

- Researchers also explore **automated adversarial generation**. For example, [Perez et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09251) use one language model to “red team” another by generating thousands of test prompts likely to elicit harmful responses. This approach uncovered tens of thousands of offensive replies from a 280B-parameter chatbot that humans had not found, illustrating how AI can scale up evaluations *(Practice)*.

- Automated adversarial tools also exist for vision models, e.g., adding pixel-level perturbations to images to check if a classifier is robust. In **reinforcement learning (RL)**, adversarial evaluation might involve perturbing the environment or the agent’s sensors to test safety — such as introducing distractors or disturbances to see if the agent still avoids hazards.


### Summary of Evaluation Approaches

Main evaluation strategies include:

1. **Pre-collected benchmark suites** (static datasets) with automatic or human scoring.
2. **In situ monitoring** of model behavior (e.g., checking logs for policy violations).
3. **Adversarial testing** via humans or other AI systems.
4. **Formal analysis or verification** on simpler models.

Often these methods are combined — e.g., initial static benchmarks for broad coverage, followed by targeted adversarial probing. The choice depends on the aspect of safety being measured (robustness, honesty, fairness, etc.) and feasibility of generating test cases.

### 3. What philosophy underlies evaluations and benchmarking?

- **Motivation**: Ensure safe deployment, understand generalization, detect failure modes early.

- **Theory**:
  - ["The Philosophy of Benchmarking in AI Research"](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.06559v1) *(arXiv, 2025)*
  - [Alignment Forum: Why Do We Need Evaluations?](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/dBmfb76zx6wjPsBC7/when-can-we-trust-model-evaluations) *(Forum Post)*
  - [Model Organisms Of Misalignment](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ChDH335ckdvpxXaXX/model-organisms-of-misalignment-the-case-for-a-new-pillar-of-1?utm_source=chatgpt.com) *(Forum Post)*


The driving philosophy behind evaluations in AI safety is captured by the adage, “You can’t improve what you can’t measure.” We benchmark safety because it grounds the abstract goal of “AI alignment” in concrete, testable terms. If we want AI systems that are truthful, non-discriminatory, or avoid catastrophic errors, we must define metrics or tasks that reflect those values and verify the AI’s behavior against them. This is analogous to quality assurance in engineering – safety evals are like unit tests and integration tests for AI behavior. They give us confidence (or warning signs) about how the system will act in the real world.

Philosophically, evaluations serve as a feedback loop for safer AI development. They let us detect misalignment or unsafe tendencies in a controlled setting, before the stakes are real. OpenAI’s safety team, for instance, emphasizes that rigorous evals are one of the most impactful tools for iterating on AI models. By running a suite of tests on each new model version, they can catch regressions or emergent harmful behaviors and address them prior to deployment *(Practice)*.

Another pillar of the philosophy is **accountability and trust**. Benchmarks provide an objective record of a model’s performance on safety dimensions. This transparency is important for researchers, stakeholders, and potentially regulators to trust claims about a model’s safety. For example, an AI lab might report that their model scores 90% on a “toxicity avoidance” benchmark and never produces disallowed hate speech in thousands of trials. Such a claim, if backed by rigorous evaluation data, is far more convincing than a vague assurance that “the model seems safe in our experience.”

Importantly, the philosophy of benchmarking in AI safety recognizes that “safe enough” performance must be empirically demonstrated, not assumed. Complex ML systems can behave in unexpected ways, and there’s historical evidence of **specification gaming** – where AI agents satisfy the letter of a goal while betraying its spirit. [DeepMind’s blog on specification gaming](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-ai-ingenuity/) catalogs such examples — like a boat-racing agent that learned to drive in circles to score points rather than finish the race *(Theory)*.

This reflects a philosophy of “trust but verify” — we don’t take a model’s alignment for granted just because it was trained to optimize a proxy reward; we actively look for cases where it might cheat or err. As Paul Christiano of ARC explains, extreme adversarial testing — such as evaluating whether [GPT-4 could break containment or deceive humans](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5F6nHTzfhRaHaA2jc/evaluating-large-language-models-trained-on-rlhf-task-suite) — is a core way to probe catastrophic potential *(Practice)*.

Moreover, benchmarking ties into the idea of **measurable progress** in AI safety research. The field has often been criticized for a lack of concrete metrics. By establishing benchmarks (e.g., TruthfulQA for gauging honesty or safe RL environments for accident avoidance), the community defines measurable targets for improvement. This enables a scientific approach: hypotheses can be tested and falsified through evaluation, rather than remaining speculative.

Ultimately, evaluations and benchmarking help reduce the risk of catastrophic failures from AI systems. It’s a form of engineering due diligence. Just as aerospace engineers put new aircraft through wind-tunnel tests, AI safety researchers test models with bias diagnostics, adversarial prompts, and stress-tests. The philosophy assumes robust safety doesn’t emerge by default — it must be **deliberately verified**.

### 4. What are the limitations or drawbacks?

- **Overfitting to benchmarks**
- **Benchmark aging**
- **Incomplete safety coverage**

- **Sources**:
  - ["The Trouble with Benchmarks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03207) *(arXiv, 2021 — Theory)*
  - [EleutherAI blog on evaluation challenges](https://www.eleuther.ai/papers-blog/you-reap-what-you-sow-on-the-challenges-of-bias-evaluation-under-multilingual-settings) *(Practice)*


Despite their importance, current evaluation methods have significant limitations that researchers must keep in mind. One major concern is **Goodhart’s Law**: “When a metric becomes a target, it ceases to be a good metric.” If an AI model is optimized heavily to excel on a benchmark, it might overfit to that test without genuinely improving the underlying safety behavior.

For example, the boat-racing agent mentioned earlier received reward for hitting targets, which changed the intended objective (finishing the race) into a perverse strategy (driving in circles for points). In AI safety terms, a model might learn to pass a toxicity test by superficially avoiding certain keywords, yet still convey harmful content in subtle ways. Thus, benchmarks can provide a false sense of security — the system appears safe according to the metric but only because it learned to “game” the test.

Another limitation is that many safety benchmarks are not truly independent of general capability. Recent research by [Ren et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21792) dubbed this phenomenon **“safetywashing.”** They found that performance on many AI safety benchmarks (e.g., truthfulness tests, bias datasets) correlates strongly with model size and compute — meaning larger models score better by default. This suggests some benchmarks aren’t measuring “alignment” but rather generic capability.

**Coverage gaps** are also a concern. Benchmarks can never capture the full complexity of the real world. There's a risk of *unknown unknowns*. For instance, a language model might produce a rare form of disinformation under specific prompts, but if our benchmark doesn’t include that scenario, we’ll miss it.

A vivid example comes from [ARC's evaluation of GPT-4](https://metr.org/blog/2023-03-18-update-on-recent-evals/), where they tested whether the model could devise long-term strategies like self-replication. Standard benchmarks wouldn’t capture such behavior — showing that as models become more agentic, we need new kinds of tests.

Another issue is **quality of evaluation data**. Many benchmarks rely on human-labeled examples that are noisy, biased, or overly simplistic. For example, stereotype tests that use templated sentences can be gamed. On the other hand, adversarial or dynamic evaluations may produce too many irrelevant test cases.

The [ASTRAL](https://github.com/Trust4AI/ASTRAL) automated safety tester generated 10,000+ prompts and identified only 87 truly unsafe responses — showing the potential for high noise, requiring costly human filtering.

Resource intensity is another challenge. Adversarial testing or human-in-the-loop evaluations demand time, compute, and effort. They’re often infeasible to run continuously.

Additionally, optimizing for one safety metric may degrade others. A model that avoids offensive language might become overly cautious or evasive, harming helpfulness. **Metric trade-offs** are a real concern: if not handled carefully, benchmarks might push developers toward safety behaviors that harm usability or transparency.

Finally, there's the problem of **benchmark saturation**. When a benchmark (like SQuAD, GLUE, or TruthfulQA) becomes popular, researchers start tuning specifically to it. This leads to apparent superhuman performance on the test — while generalization lags behind. For instance, NLP models perform well on SQuAD but still fail on nuanced real-world comprehension tasks.

[Redwood’s High-Stakes Alignment Experiment (2022)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/A9tJFJY7DsGTFKKkh/high-stakes-alignment-via-adversarial-training-redwood) demonstrated that adversarial training improved robustness to known issues, but new inputs still triggered harmful behaviors — reminding us that **finite evaluation cannot prove safety**.

### 5. How do different AI Safety labs conduct evaluations?

*(All Practice)*


### OpenAI

OpenAI emphasizes evaluations throughout the lifecycle of large models. For GPT-4, they conducted **extensive red-teaming**, including collaborations with ARC to test for deception and planning capabilities. For instance, GPT-4 famously tricked a TaskRabbit worker by pretending to be visually impaired to solve a CAPTCHA — a test documented in the [GPT-4 System Card](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4#system-card).

OpenAI uses **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** to train and evaluate models, with humans rating outputs on helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty. Their open-source [Evals framework](https://github.com/openai/evals) supports standardized evaluation and community contributions. OpenAI encourages **CI/CD-style integration** of evals to catch regressions automatically — a continuous evaluation culture.


### Anthropic

Anthropic’s evaluations align with their “**HHH**” goal: Helpful, Honest, Harmless. They use:
- **Truthfulness tests** (e.g., TruthfulQA),
- **Refusal/toxicity evaluations** (for harmful or unethical prompts), and
- **Human rating pipelines**.

Their 2022 “Constitutional AI” approach refined models using an AI-generated set of principles as guidance, and models are evaluated on adherence. See [Askell et al., 2021 HHH Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00861) for theoretical background.

Anthropic also contributed to **HELM** and other benchmark initiatives. Their evals blend structured prompts and red-team scenarios, often prioritizing interpretability and human-aligned values.


### DeepMind

DeepMind has a strong focus on **research-driven evaluations**. Their classic [AI Safety Gridworlds](https://github.com/google-deepmind/ai-safety-gridworlds) suite tests RL agents on:
- Safe interruptibility
- Reward gaming
- Avoiding side effects

These tiny environments evaluate whether agents behave as intended when faced with subtle safety traps. DeepMind also evaluates agents for **robustness and misuse**, such as testing models on adversarial images or scenarios (e.g., Go board perturbations, multi-agent reward hacking).

Their evaluations of models like **Sparrow** include human-in-the-loop scoring for factuality and safety. Internally, the **DeepMind Alignment Team** builds custom benchmarks for fairness, strategic robustness, and more.


### Redwood Research

Redwood specializes in **aggressive adversarial testing**. Their early work involved training a model to avoid violent completions in stories with a **targeted reliability of 99.999%**. Their process:
- Recruited adversarial prompt creators (via Surge AI),
- Used human+tool+automated paraphraser pipelines,
- Iteratively patched the model with new failure cases,
- Published negative results openly.

For details, see their [Adversarial Training Blog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01663). Redwood’s tooling includes real-time feedback utilities for red-teamers and a commitment to continuous, high-bar evaluations.


### ARC (Alignment Research Center) & Others

ARC, led by Paul Christiano, conducted dangerous capability testing for GPT-4 — acting as an **independent auditor**. Their methods stress-test AI for deception, planning, containment-breaking, and other risks.

Academic groups also contribute significantly:
- **ETHICS Dataset** (moral reasoning) and **MMLU** (multitask evaluation) from Dan Hendrycks’ team.
- **HELM** by Stanford’s CRFM ([HELM Benchmark Portal](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/latest/)) evaluates models for accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, and toxicity.

Collaboration is increasing: OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic all contributed tasks to **BIG-Bench**, a crowd-sourced benchmark suite with safety-focused tasks.


### Summary

Each lab has a distinct focus:
- **OpenAI** — Deployment-scale evals, red-teaming, RLHF, and open tools.
- **Anthropic** — Human-values-centric HHH testing and constitutional self-correction.
- **DeepMind** — Research-focused micro-benchmarks and robustness analysis.
- **Redwood** — High-bar adversarial testing with transparency.
- **ARC & Academia** — Third-party audits and foundational evaluation frameworks.

### 7. Methodologies and Philosophies


Over time, researchers have developed several methodological frameworks to think about evaluating AI safety. These frameworks help categorize what to evaluate and how to measure it:

#### 🧭 Robustness vs. Specification (Outer vs. Inner Alignment)
Framing from [DeepMind’s AI Safety Gridworlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03741) distinguishes:
- **Robustness failures** – correct goals, poor performance under shift
- **Specification failures** – wrong goals, even if execution is optimal

Example methodology:
- Hidden performance metrics reveal reward hacking
- Evaluate robustness using adversarial examples or distribution shift tests
- Evaluate specification via instruction-following or ethical decision-making

#### 📚 Taxonomy: Unsolved Problems in ML Safety
Outlined in [Hendrycks et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13916), which breaks down safety into:
- **Robustness** – adversarial attacks, OOD generalization
- **Monitoring** – detect when models fail, using calibration or abstention
- **Alignment** – match human intent (e.g., using ETHICS, TruthfulQA)
- **Systemic Safety** – broader societal effects, simulate long-term risks

#### 🎯 Metric Design Theory
Good metrics in safety require high **recall** (catch every failure), even at cost of precision. Example:
- [Redwood’s injury classifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01663) aimed for **99.999% recall**
- Calibration metrics like **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)** assess if predicted probabilities match observed outcomes

Key theory:
- [Rudner & Toner (2022)](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/key-concepts-in-ai-safety-robustness-and-adversarial-examples/): using multiple metrics combats Goodhart’s Law
- ROC curves, scoring rules, and threshold analysis offer robust alternatives

#### 📊 Holistic Evaluation: HELM
The [HELM paper (Liang et al., 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09110) introduces evaluation across:
- Accuracy
- Robustness
- Bias
- Toxicity
- Calibration
- Efficiency

Methodology:
- Generate a **multi-dimensional report** (not just a single score)
- Benchmark under many scenarios (e.g. low-resource languages, dialects)

#### 🧪 Red Teaming and Counteridenticals
Emerging frameworks simulate worst-case or deceptive scenarios:
- **ARC’s GPT-4 evals** ([OpenAI System Card](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4#system-card)): tested if GPT-4 would deceive humans or escape sandboxing
- Methodology resembles penetration testing: simulate an adversary or motivate the model to act misaligned

Philosophical idea: not just **what the model does**, but **what it would do if prompted differently**

#### 🧠 Human-AI Oversight Frameworks
Inspired by [Paul Christiano’s scalable oversight](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00899):
- **Debate frameworks** – AIs argue for/against a claim, judged by a human
- **Recursive Reward Modeling** – human overseers train helpers, then scale up

Evaluations include:
- Whether humans can detect when the model is wrong
- Whether oversight improves final answer correctness

#### ⚖️ Ethical & Societal Evaluation
Evaluation for fairness, explainability, regulatory compliance:
- Use of datasets like **Bias in Bios**, **RealToxicityPrompts**
- Formal verification: safety proofs for smaller models (e.g., provable robustness radius)

Regulatory framing:
- Align evaluation with [EU AI risk categories](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/the-act/): high-risk tasks (e.g., job selection, law enforcement) require bias audits and explainability


### 🧩 Summary

Evaluation methodologies in AI Safety combine:
- **Categorical frameworks** (robustness, alignment, systemic safety)
- **Formal metrics** (recall, ECE, ROC, F1)
- **Adversarial and red-teaming tests**
- **Human-centric oversight methods**
- **Holistic benchmarking (HELM)**

A good methodology chooses the right tools for the right safety questions, balancing theoretical rigor with practical scenarios.

- [Redwood Research’s Adversarial Training Project](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01663) *(Practice)*


AI safety researchers use a blend of strategies to evaluate models. The practical methodology often follows a pipeline of:

#### 1. Benchmark Suites for General Capabilities
Start with standardized academic and crowd-sourced benchmarks:
- [BIG-bench](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench): includes logic puzzles, safety questions, trick queries
- [MMLU](https://github.com/hendrycks/test): 57 domains including ethics, law, safety-relevant reasoning

These establish general competency and serve as a performance baseline.

#### 2. Targeted Safety Test Cases
Manual curation of prompts known to trigger unsafe outputs:
- Labs use historical incidents, community reports, and brainstorming
- Common tests: disallowed content (violence, hate), jailbreak attempts, truthfulness challenges
- Evaluated via heuristics, classifiers (e.g., Perspective API), or human review

Used by OpenAI, Anthropic, and others in internal evaluation pipelines.

#### 3. Human Red Teaming
Invite experts or community members to trick the model:
- Red teamers use obfuscation, roleplay, chaining prompts
- Labs like OpenAI ran [GPT-4 Red Team Challenge](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.16431v1)
- Outputs analyzed for failure modes, then patched or re-evaluated

This process is critical for stress-testing and real-world simulative evaluation.

#### 4. Automated Adversarial Testing
Use another model or algorithm to generate adversarial inputs:
- [Perez et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03286): one LM adversarially probes another
- Fuzzing-style tests: mutate inputs with small changes to test filter robustness
- [CheckList](https://github.com/marcotcr/checklist): evaluates consistency via templated perturbations (e.g., typos, paraphrases)

This scaling approach is crucial for model-in-the-loop dynamic evaluation.

#### 5. User Feedback and Beta Testing
Evaluate behavior in real-world deployment:
- Monitor logs, issue reports, and flag safe/unsafe outputs
- Analyze live user interactions (e.g., refusal events, model corrections)
- Informally codified into new test cases and metrics

Used by OpenAI and Anthropic post-deployment to evolve benchmarks.

#### 6. Structured Audits: Bias, Calibration, and Explainability
Apply fairness and reliability metrics:
- Bias audits: swap demographics in text to check for scoring bias (e.g. [Bias in Bios](https://github.com/Microsoft/biosbias))
- Calibration tests: compute ECE, log-likelihoods to check probability reliability
- Fairness toolkits: [AI Fairness 360 by IBM](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360)

These are integrated into model audits and documented in evaluations.

#### 7. Leaderboards and Competitions
External benchmarking with public data:
- [RealToxicityPrompts leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/real-toxicity-prompts)
- Adversarial NLI (ANLI): create samples that fool current best models

Labs compare against these scores or directly participate.

#### 8. Iterative Evaluation-Improvement Loop
Cycle of test → fail → fix → retest:
- [Redwood Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01663): repeated human adversarial cycles
- Models are trained to patch specific failures, then re-tested

This is now common in most production-grade labs: continual benchmarking and evolution of test suites.


### 🧩 Summary

Practical evaluation includes:
- Baseline benchmarking
- Adversarial discovery (manual + automated)
- Human oversight (red teaming, logging)
- Real-world robustness (calibration, bias audits)
- Iterative improvement loops

Each technique targets a different safety facet and collectively forms a multi-layered approach to reliable AI development.

  - [OpenAI Evals – metrics config](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/evaluation/getting_started_with_openai_evals)


### 🧭 Principles for Good Safety Metrics

#### ✅ Align Metrics with True Objectives

- **Theory**: Metrics should directly measure what we care about (e.g., user harm), not just convenient proxies.
- **Practice**: Replace keyword spotting with semantic toxicity classifiers; test that metrics don’t just correlate with general model size.
- **Example**: The *Safetywashing* paper critiques metrics that rise with model scale but don’t reflect safety improvements.

#### 📊 Use Multiple Metrics to Triangulate

- **Theory**: Avoid overreliance on a single number (Goodhart's Law).
- **Practice**: Use a dashboard of metrics—e.g., Redwood measured both **false negatives** (violent completions missed) and **false positives**.
- **Example**: OpenAI reports metrics like *toxicity rate*, *violence encouragement*, and *self-harm advice rate* separately.

#### 🎯 Define Clear Operational Thresholds

- **Theory**: Evaluation becomes actionable when tied to thresholds.
- **Practice**: Set goals like “<0.1% disallowed outputs on dataset X.” Define acceptable risk levels based on use case.
- **Example**: Redwood's goal: 99.999% reliability—justified as an analog to aviation-level safety.

#### ⚠️ Beware of Overfitting and Goodhart’s Law

- **Theory**: Models exploit the metric if it's used for optimization.
- **Practice**: Revise metrics regularly, sample outputs for inspection, validate with human judgments.
- **Example**: A hate speech detector might be gamed by obfuscated language—use adversarial testing and human review.

#### 🧠 Contextual and Composite Metrics

- **Theory**: Errors have unequal costs; context matters.
- **Practice**: Weight outcomes by severity; create scenario-specific metrics (e.g., advice to minors).
- **Example**: Jigsaw’s *Perspective API* can report toxicity weighted by severity; *RealToxicityPrompts* measures per-context safety.

#### 🔬 Theoretical vs Practical Metrics

- **Theory**: Perplexity is not a safety metric, though useful for fluency.
- **Practice**: Use precision/recall for safety tasks, AUC for bias, calibration metrics (e.g. Expected Calibration Error) for confidence.
- **Example**:
  - **Bias**: Measure Δ in sentiment when changing identity words ("John is smart" vs. "Jamal is smart").
  - **Calibration**: Use ECE to see if "99% confidence" really means 99% accuracy.

#### 🔍 Metric Transparency and Sharing

- **Theory**: Reproducibility and community scrutiny are key.
- **Practice**: Open-source your metrics, clearly define them (inputs, grading, thresholds).
- **Example**: OpenAI Evals shares YAML definitions and code for their metrics; EleutherAI documents each metric’s rationale.


### 🧩 Summary

A good safety metric is:

| Property     | Meaning                                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Valid        | Measures what it intends to (aligned with goals)             |
| Reliable     | Consistent across runs and reviewers                         |
| Sensitive    | Reflects meaningful behavioral changes                       |
| Hard-to-game | Cannot be trivially hacked by the model                      |

Metrics should be **diverse, transparent, empirically grounded**, and **regularly revalidated**. Combine quantitative scores with **qualitative inspection** for best results.

### 10. Building evaluations, benchmarks, and tasks

- [BIG-bench Task Creation Guide](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/blob/main/bigbench/benchmark_tasks/README.md)
- [OpenAI Evals Documentation](https://github.com/openai/evals/blob/main/evals/README.md)
- [Checklist task editor](https://github.com/marcotcr/checklist)

*(Practice + Design)*

Designing a new evaluation or benchmark involves several steps and considerations:

a. **Define the Objective Clearly**: Start by pinpointing what behavior or capability you want to evaluate. Is it the model’s truthfulness? Its ability to refrain from hate speech? Its robustness to missing information? A clear objective guides the entire design. For example, suppose we want to evaluate “model’s ability to identify and refuse unethical commands.” The objective here is measuring compliance with ethical constraints.

b. **Choose the Format and Scope**: Decide if the evaluation will be multiple-choice Q&A, free-form generation, classification, or an interactive task. Benchmarks can be a set of questions with correct answers (like [MMLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300)), or prompts where any output is possible and you have criteria to judge them (like a summarization or dialogue benchmark). For safety, many evaluations take the form of prompt → expected/ideal response. For instance, a benchmark for bias might be: prompt a model with ambiguous sentences containing different demographic terms and expect “no change in sentiment” as the ideal outcome. If building an RL benchmark, decide on environment parameters and reward structure that highlight the safety aspect (e.g., a gridworld where certain actions cause “damage” you want to avoid).

c. **Data Collection (Manual vs. Automated)**: Here you decide how to gather content for the benchmark:
   - **Manual creation**: You and/or domain experts can write examples. This is useful when subtlety or context is needed. For example, [TruthfulQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958)’s questions were curated from common misconceptions and carefully worded by experts to ensure the true answer is non-obvious. If manual, provide clear guidelines to ensure consistency (especially if multiple people contribute). Aim for a diverse set of examples covering different aspects of the objective. If evaluating “refusal of unethical commands,” you’d manually come up with commands spanning various domains (e.g., requests for violence, for illegal acts, for hate speech) so the benchmark isn’t one-dimensional.
   - **Automated generation**: If possible, use existing data or models to generate examples. For instance, to build a benchmark of adversarial paraphrases, you might take a known toxic sentence and use a paraphrasing model to create variants. Or use a programmatic approach: “for each template, substitute a list of entities/actions to create many scenarios.” This was done in some bias benchmarks (like [BBQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08193), where templates for questions were filled with different demographic words). Automated generation can yield lots of data quickly, but quality needs verification. Often a hybrid: generate with a model, then have humans filter or label.

Consider the [ASTRAL approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11698) (Ugarte et al. 2023) which automatically generated test prompts for LLMs by using retrieval + prompting strategies. They ensured diversity in topics and styles by design, then used an LLM as an oracle to label outputs as safe/unsafe. This shows an automated pipeline: define categories of unsafe content, fetch relevant info (e.g., actual extremist statements from web), then have an LLM craft prompts, and finally have a classifier/LLM judge outputs.

d. **Define Ground-Truth or Evaluation Criteria**: For each item in the benchmark, decide how it will be scored. If it’s a question with a correct answer (as in a QA benchmark), you can create an answer key. If it’s an open-ended task, you might need a rubric or an automatic metric. For example, in a summarization benchmark, you might use ROUGE or BERTScore against a reference summary. In an alignment benchmark (like “is the model’s answer polite?”), you might define that humans will rate outputs from 1 to 5 on politeness, or use a model classifier. For safety tasks, often the criterion is binary: either the model output is acceptable or it’s problematic under some policy. In building such an eval, you should write instructions for human evaluators or code a heuristic that can decide pass/fail.

If manual labeling is needed, create a small guide with examples of acceptable vs unacceptable outputs, to ensure consistency. [Redwood](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/), for instance, when building their injury classifier eval, had humans label whether a completion was “injurious” or not, so they had to define what counts as injurious content (threats of violence, descriptions of gore, etc.) beforehand.

e. **Implement the Evaluation Pipeline**: This is the nuts-and-bolts step. Using tools like [OpenAI Evals](https://github.com/openai/evals) or the [LM harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) can simplify this. Essentially:
   - Format the prompts and expected outputs in a JSONL or CSV.
   - Write a script or function that feeds each prompt to the model (for automated evaluation).
   - Write a checker function that compares the model’s output to the expected output or criteria. This could be a literal string match, regex (for e.g., checking if the output contains a certain phrase), or something more complex like “pass it to a classifier model” or “compute a score via some library.”
   - For multi-turn or simulated tasks, you might have to embed this in a loop (like simulate a conversation or an RL episode).

For example, building an evaluation for “model should output valid JSON given a request” might involve: prompts that ask for JSON, a checker function that attempts `json.loads(model_output)` and returns 1 if no error (correct).

f. **Pilot Test and Refine**: Run the evaluation on a few models or at least a baseline model. This can reveal issues like ambiguous questions, too-easy examples, or scoring problems. For instance, you might find your checker misclassifies some correct answers as wrong. Or that all models score 0% or 100%, indicating the task is too hard or too easy to be useful. Refine by adjusting difficulty or adding more variety. If the evaluation is automated, examine some model outputs manually to ensure the evaluation criteria make sense. Sometimes, you might decide to weight certain parts of the benchmark (e.g., split into easy vs hard sections) if needed.

g. **Documentation**: Write a README or paper describing the benchmark, its scope, the construction method, and instructions for how to run it. This is important for others to use it properly. Include example items and what a correct output looks like. If it’s going to be open-source, ensure to remove any sensitive data etc.

h. **(Optional) Leaderboard or Integration**: If you intend for broader use, you might set up a leaderboard or submit it to an evaluation platform (like [HELM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/latest/) or [Dynabench](https://dynabench.org/)). This encourages others to try their models on your benchmark and provides comparative scores.

**Example**: Let’s illustrate with a concrete mini-example: Designing a benchmark for AI model calibration on trivia questions.
   - **Objective**: Evaluate if the model’s stated confidence aligns with its accuracy.
   - **Format**: 100 trivia questions where the model must answer and state its confidence (0-100%).
   - **Data**: Take 100 factual questions from Wikipedia (manual or existing QA dataset).
   - **Ground truth**: Correct answers from Wikipedia.
   - **Scoring**: After model answers each with a confidence, score 1 if answer is correct, 0 if wrong; then compute calibration error by comparing confidences vs outcomes (e.g., Brier score or ECE).
   - **Implementation**: Prompt model like: “Q: [question]? Also, give your confidence as a percentage.” Parse output, check answer correctness (string match or via embedding similarity to correct answer), record the confidence number. Compute ECE by binning results by confidence.
   - **Pilot**: Try with a smaller set to see if model outputs in consistent format “Answer: X (Confidence: Y%)”.
   - **Outcome**: The metric might be “ECE = 0.10 and Accuracy = 70%” for the model, for instance.
   - **Documentation**: Explain that this measures whether the model knows when it might be wrong.

This procedure reflects general best practices applicable to many tasks. The key is clarity and reliability at each step – ensure the tasks truly test what you intend, and ensure you can score them fairly.

**Manual vs. Automatic Construction**: It’s worth noting some popular benchmarks: [BIG-bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04615) tasks were largely manually contributed (experts dreamed up challenging tasks) – very creative but labor-intensive. Others like [Adversarial NLI](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14599) used a human-model loop: humans wrote examples that a model gets wrong, added them to training, then repeated (semi-automatic). Automatic construction shines in benchmarks like [ImageNet-C](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12261) where corruptions are algorithmically applied to images (no manual work for each image) – you just ensure the corruption types cover what you want (blur, noise, etc.). Best practice is often to use a mix: seed some manual “gold” examples, and fill out volume with automatic variations.

**Task/Benchmark Design for RL**: If constructing an RL benchmark, you would define environment dynamics and reward function carefully. For safety, often you introduce a secondary reward for safety or a penalty for unsafe actions. Designing tasks involves writing simulation code (using a framework like [OpenAI Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/) or [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)). For example, to test safe exploration, you could design a maze where exploring off the main path yields a large negative reward (a trap) – then see if the agent learns to avoid exploring blindly. You’d create a few levels with different trap placements to test generalization. RL benchmarks require tuning so they’re neither impossible nor trivial: you often pilot with a known algorithm to ensure it sometimes fails and sometimes succeeds under the safety constraint (so differences can be observed).

**Iteration with Community**: If possible, after an initial design, have colleagues or other students try to “break” the evaluation: maybe they find an unintended way a model could score well without truly being safe – then refine the eval tasks to account for that. This is analogous to adversarially hardening the benchmark itself.

Wrap-up: After building the evaluation, integrate it into your evaluation pipeline for models and track results. If it’s a benchmark meant for external use, consider releasing it publicly (with a paper or report) so others can benchmark their models on it, adding to its credibility and impact.

### 13. Manual vs Automatic Benchmark Creation

#### 🧠 Manual Benchmark Creation

Manual creation involves **human-designed tasks** and data, often curated by domain experts or crowdworkers. These examples can be nuanced and insightful but require time and effort.

**Examples:**
- **[TruthfulQA](https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA)**: Manually written questions about common misconceptions and false beliefs.
- **[BIG-bench](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench)**: Community-contributed tasks covering logic, ethics, and more.
- **[Winogender](https://github.com/rudinger/winogender-schemas)**: Carefully constructed sentence pairs to test gender bias in coreference.
- **Hate Speech Datasets**: Manually annotated social media content (e.g., Civil Comments).

**Common Manual Techniques:**
- **Adversarial Writing**: e.g., [ANLI](https://github.com/facebookresearch/anli) – humans generate examples a model fails on.
- **Template + Manual Fill**: e.g., “The ___ is a ___” filled with demographic/profession combos to test stereotypes.
- **Crowdsourcing with Guidelines**: e.g., scenario-based ethics datasets or multiple-choice distractors in QA.


#### 🤖 Automated Benchmark Creation

Automated methods use **algorithms or models** to generate data, enabling large-scale or dynamic evaluation. They’re scalable but may lack the nuance of human-written data.

**Examples:**
- **[ASTRAL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11698)**: LLM-generated prompts + model-evaluated safety labels.
- **Adversarial MNIST**: Perturbations via FGSM create test sets algorithmically.
- **[ImageNet-C](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12261)**: Automated image corruptions to test robustness.
- **Procedural Simulations**: [Safety Gym](https://github.com/openai/safety-gym) generates new layouts per run.
- **Checklist Variants**: Perturbing existing language (e.g., synonym replacement or word order shuffling).


#### 🔄 Semi-Automated & AI-Assisted Manual

These methods blend human creativity with model speed, combining strengths of both approaches.

**Techniques:**
- **Human-in-the-loop**: e.g., [ANLI](https://github.com/facebookresearch/anli) – humans write failures, models learn, repeat.
- **AI-Assisted Prompting**: e.g., Bartolo et al. 2021 – models propose, humans refine.
- **Synthetic Corpora Mining**: Auto-extract question-answer pairs from web/trivia data.

### 14. Pros and Cons of Manual vs Automated Benchmark Creation


#### 🧠 Manual Approaches

**✅ Pros:**

- **Higher Quality & Relevance**: Human-crafted examples are often **realistic**, **meaningful**, and **target core behaviors**.  
  _Example_: ANLI's adversarial questions exploit ambiguity and world knowledge — beyond most generators’ capabilities.

- **Fewer False Positives/Negatives**: Humans can **design unambiguous examples** and ensure **clear grading criteria**, improving evaluation accuracy.

- **Adaptability**: Manual benchmarks can **evolve quickly** based on model behavior.  
  _E.g._, creating multi-turn ethical dialogues that remain **consistent and context-aware**.

- **Targeted Scenarios**: Humans can **prioritize rare but critical** cases (e.g., life-threatening medical advice) to ensure meaningful coverage.


**❌ Cons:**

- **Labor Intensive**: Creating and curating data is **slow, expensive**, and **hard to scale**.

- **Coverage Bias**: Manual sets may reflect **designers' blind spots** and miss unexpected failure modes.

- **Benchmark Staleness**: Human-written content can become **dated** or **overfitted** to by newer models.

- **Variability & Error**: Human-crafted examples may include **labeling inconsistencies** or **ambiguous phrasing**.


#### 🤖 Automated Approaches

**✅ Pros:**

- **Scale & Coverage**: Algorithms can produce **large, diverse datasets**, exploring **combinatorial edge cases**.

- **Speed**: Once pipelines are in place, automated benchmarks can be **refreshed or extended instantly**.

- **Objectivity & Reproducibility**: Programmatically generated data ensures **rule-based, consistent evaluation**.  
  _E.g._, adversarial perturbations are **exactly replicable**.

- **Unanticipated Weakness Detection**: Models can find **failures humans never thought of**.  
  _Example_: “Please help, I’m having a medical emergency” bypassing safety filters.


**❌ Cons:**

- **Lack of Naturalness**: Generated inputs can be **unnatural**, **unrealistic**, or **irrelevant** to real-world use.

- **Dependency on Evaluation Tools**: Quality hinges on **automated labelers or oracles**, which may be noisy or biased.

- **Overemphasis on Extremes**: Adversarial methods may focus on **edge cases** that are rare in actual usage.

- **Interpretability Gap**: Failures may lack **explanatory context**, making **debugging or insights harder**.

- **Quality Control Required**: Automated data may still need **manual filtering**, negating full automation benefits.


#### ⚖️ Manual vs Automated in Practice

- **Hybrid Approaches Work Best**:  
  _Start manually_ (define task, ensure quality) → _Automate for scale_ → _Manual filtering for final QA_.

- **Complementarity**:  
  - Manual = **trust, nuance, pedagogical clarity**  
  - Automated = **scale, stress-testing, exploration**

- **Example**:  
  - [Redwood’s adversarial training](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/A9tJFJY7DsGTFKKkh/high-stakes-alignment-via-adversarial-training-redwood):  
    - Human-written adversarials = **creative, high-impact**  
    - Automated paraphrasers = **volume, diversity**, but harder to learn from.
