# ml4good_prep

## Motivation
I created this repo to document my preparation for the ML4Good Italy 2025 bootcamp. 

The goal is to sharpen my machine learning skills and cover the official prep curriculum before the program begins. This includes diving into theoretical readings (some on AI safety and ML concepts), refreshing core math (like linear algebra), and getting hands-on practice with PyTorch. I’m treating this repo as a personal learning journal + sandbox. It’s a place to explore, make mistakes, and reflect on what I learn each day.
