# Half-assing it with everything you've got
by Nate Soares

Nate writes that he bugs a bunch of people in EA and beyond whose main source of motivation is guilt and shame. He has a rule not to devalue anything that leads people to EA actions, but in his view guilt and shame are pretty lousy motivators in the long run.

## Part 1. slackers vs tryers
School teaches that there are slackers and tryers. In our culture, being the latter is good and the former is bad.
But Nate says both are wrong — you need to set a concrete goal and go after exactly that (e.g. get an A+, earn your reputation in class, etc.
### my thoughts:

- A graduation speech (http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/23/ssc-gives-a-graduation-speech/) by Scott Alexander — an interesting read on a very similar topic

- The whole frame makes me a bit uneasy: yes, a grading scale is a weird thing to internalise, but sometimes there isn’t another option— cos of unknown unknowns (or known unknowns). 
Asking yourself in sixth grade “why do I need math?” is honestly hard if the answer involves the sheer joy of algebraic topology. I simply don’t yet know how to think or talk about that. Effort opens up new possibilities. It’s handy to discover them with an external scale.

## Part 2. Some things are too important to “half-ass.”
A common objection — half-assing saving lives isn’t the same as half-assing homework.

> Given any project, always aim no higher than the quality target, and always strive for minimum expenditure of effort.

Nate says that in any endeavor the goal is to reach some quality metric with minimal effort.
If the target value of the metric lies to the right of our current maximum capabilities, then the strategy of pushing yourself to do your very best is reasonable and justified. But don’t confuse the quality scale of results with your preference scale.

> The essential point is to be able to differentiate between the implicit quality line highlighted circumstance, and your actual preference curve.

Nate also warns against the planning fallacy and asks you not to read him with your ass:
> I’m decidedly not saying that you must always identify the worst outcome that you’d grudgingly accept as your target.

## Part 3.Shooting for the minimum acceptable quality is fun
>Doing the homework assignment is boring, but finding a way to get the homework assignment up to an acceptable level with as little total effort as possible is an interesting optimization problem.

Usually reframing toward minimal effort makes the task more fun, but if—even after identifying your target metric and reframing—the task still feels dreary, it makes sense to think about dropping it.

And Nate also says that if perfectionism gets in the way of reframing toward minimal effort, you can turn that perfectionism on the very process of doing things with minimal effort. Perfectionism is instrumental; it shouldn’t choose your goals.

## Part 4. Much more difficult task
Tasks framed around minimal effort can become or feel harder. But a quality scale for the product systematically breeds a lot of guilt and shame, so Nate says that’s the lesser of two evils.

>If you’ve got to feel guilty, feel guilty about missing your own targets rather than about not adopting some arbitrary quality line as your true preferences.

### my thoughts

- It seems the real problem is guilt and shame themselves—and separately the optimization criteria—and here they’re a bit tangled. On the first point, I think efforts aimed at eliminating guilt from the phenomenal experience can really pay off. In other words, I wouldn’t accept compromises that just shift the focus of guilt; I’d aim to eradicate the very capacity to feel guilt (while still functioning in society).

- The optimization criteria are trickier. Learning to optimize across two parameters seems broadly useful, but that kind of takeaway runs directly counter to the essay’s core message as I see it—about setting concrete goals rather than simply squeezing out as much effort as you can.

## Part 5. Succeed, with no wasted motion.
Nate says most people oscillate between “going with the flow” (exerting zero effort) and “giving it their all” (burning every last drop of energy). Instead, you should apply just the necessary minimum—the amount needed to hit the point on your personal preference curve, not some generic quality scale. Your target should be based on your own preferences, not on an external standard.

> Very few people seem able to pick a midpoint target and then go after it with everything they've got.

### my thoughts
- Yud’s essay is relevant here too—it argues that you should focus not on how much effort you could apply, but on how much effort the task actually requires.
And I find both Nate’s and Yud’s advice personally useful. But I notice, they assume you’ve got a finely tuned high-level model of your own preferences and goals, plus an accurate self-model of your abilities and limits.
