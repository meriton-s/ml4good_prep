## what i’m doing today
- finish writing proper notes on yesterday’s work
- complete the Introduction to PyTorch and Gradient Descent notebook  
  (https://colab.research.google.com/github/EffiSciencesResearch/ML4G-2.0/blob/master/workshops/pytorch_tuto/pytorch_tuto.ipynb)
- start watching the assigned video playlist — figure out how to take notes as i go

## stream of consciousness
what if i end up caffeine-deprived during ML4GOOD? need to stock up on energy drinks — x3, just in case.  
should i bring my ridiculous pen? it's completely impractical for travel but it did help me derive half of backprop by hand, so...

model wasn’t training. reading the code aloud helped. (swapped variable names, Slava, really...) maybe i should bring a duck to read code to. rubber duck debugging but literal.

anyway — focus. enough stalling. time to actually do the work.
