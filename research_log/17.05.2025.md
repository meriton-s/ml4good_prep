## what i’m doing today
- start the tensor notebook
- push all code to GitHub
- at least glance at the math

## stream of consciousness
- yesterday i couldn’t buckle down on prep because i spent the whole day wrestling with phd paperwork and booking tickets, so today’s shaping up to be a long one
- alright, tensors—let’s do this
- i re-read the notation once more (after the video it finally clicked a bit better)
### takeaway: 
- Write each index at most twice; if it’s twice, it’s summed. 
- The remaining (free) indices define the shape of the result. 
- If it is more than twice it's an error.

- einops is fun, but installing it locally is still a headache. i probably need to drop it
- i really need to carve out time to diagram the exercises from the day before yesterday—i can’t remember half of what i did
- einops exercises are fun, but the author of the tasks seems to be testing our applied telepathy—about half the time I just can’t figure out what they want from me.
and that grayscale exercise was next-level. who’d guess a channel×width collapse?!
## results
pushed the “intro to pytorch” notebook code

finished the first einops block

## technical debt
push the computational-graph script

make diagrams of the 05/15 exercises from my log

figure out how to spot the grayscale collapse hint
to figure out if there was any way to guess that the grayscale gradations result from collapsing the channel and width dimensions.

## ideas
make an “extras” folder for side experiments
