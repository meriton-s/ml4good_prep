## what i’m doing today
- finish the tensor exercises
- push everything to GitHub
- pack my staff for ML4Good
- 
## stream of consciousness
- i don’t know where 18th went. i’m so tired i can’t even process it. but here i am, still prepping for camp
- today i need to kill the tensor exercises because i fly out tomorrow night

- feels like i’m finally getting the hang of einops logic

 
### quick hints
- no arithmetic? → rearrange
- need to sum/mean/max/min? → reduce
- want to tile/broadcast data? → repeat

- seriously though, i was coding yesterday—where did that day go?!

## results
- Broke down the logic of the three einops operations (rearrange, reduce, repeat)
- Found and fixed the bug in temperatures_average (trying to take a mean on a LongTensor)
